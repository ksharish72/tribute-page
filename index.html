      <p>Thinking of South Indian acting legend Rajinikanth, the only word that comes to mind is 'invincible.'</p>
<p>
  Mind you, we're not referring to those superlative jokes we read and laugh at every day.</p>
<p>
Born Shivaji Rao Gaikwad on December 12, 1950, he's one of very few actors who had truly humble beginnings and has managed to stay on top of the game all through his career, reigning in the hearts of audiences across the globe.
      </p><p>
It's inspiring to think of how a bus conductor from Bangalore went on to become the highest paid actor in Indian cinema.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-6 col-lg-6">
        <p>Rajinikanth's father Ramoji Rao Gaikwad was a police constable and had a meagre income.</p>
<p>
After the death of his mother Jijabai, Rajinikanth, the youngest of four siblings, realised that their family's financial position was delicate and that they were suffering. Growing up, he worked as a coolie to support his family.
        </p><p>
After completing his schooling from the Government Model Primary School at Gavipuram, Bangalore, he took up odd jobs at various places in Chennai and Bangalore.</p>
<p>
He even worked as a carpenter and a bus conductor for the Bangalore Transport Service (BTS) before becoming an actor.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-6 col-lg-6"><p>Since Rajini was keen on acting, he joined the Madras Film Institute to learn more about films.
        </p><p>
During one of his stage plays, he met director K Balachander, who offered him a role in his forthcoming Tamil film.
        </p><p>
When the noted director suggested that he learn to speak Tamil, he quickly followed through and took lessons that helped him master the language.
        </p><p>
He often refers to Balachander as one of his first mentors in the film industry.

      <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-6 col-lg-6">
        <p>In 1975, when Rajini made his big-screen debut in Apoorva Raagangal, he had a very small role to play. With Kamal Hassan playing the lead role of hero, his performance as a villain was noticed by few.</p>
<p>
Still, it helped him bag several negative roles over the next two years, until he was finally cast in a lead role in the Telugu film Chilakamma Cheppindi, directed by S P Muthuraman in the year 1975.
        </p><p>
And there's been no looking back.

<p>        When was the last time you read a Rajinikanth interview? Chances are it was a long time ago, as they're extremely rare -- the superstar is famously reticent when it comes to speaking about himself to the press.
        </p><p>
       
Even though the media follows him everywhere he goes, he's one of very few celebrities who prefer to let their work do the talking.
        </p>

    <div class="text-center"><h3>5.Be yourself and don't give in to vanity</h3></div>
  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-6 col-lg-6">

      <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-6 col-lg-6">
<p>If you've ever met the superstar in real life or seen photos of him off-screen, you will realise that he has no qualms about aging, nor about balding and grey hair.
        </p><p>
When asked about this stance in an interview, he explained, "It is important to them how you look on celluloid, they're paying for that. There they feel, my hero should look like a hero. Outside it doesn't matter. People are intelligent, they know everything. Why unnecessarily give yourself discomfort?"
        </p><p>
In 2007, he was paid Rs 26 crore for his role in Sivaji, which made him the highest-paid actor in Asia after Jackie Chan. Yet Rajinikanth has no airs of stardom and remains humble. Co-actors and crew members have shared stories of how he prefers to sleep on the sets, without a pillow, covering his eyes with a wet cloth. He also prefers driving his own car and refuses to be attended to by a retinue during shoots and outdoor events.
        </p><p>
The current generation of actors will perhaps never imbibe some of his traits, but his simple ways of life and mantras for success are definitely worth aspiring to....!</p>
